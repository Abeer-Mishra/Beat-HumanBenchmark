# Beat-HumanBenchmark
Here is the Python code that beats every single Human Benchmark Test. Some of them are under-development and later some will be converted to cs for extra speed.

NOTE --> Each script uses an mss liberary that takes screenshots of your screen in-order to get the answer. In Each Script there is a Monitor dict, Edit 
          it to suit your monitors needs. (A Screen Location Calculator is included)

          IT MAY NOT WORK ON MAC OS
